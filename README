It's traffic video counting tool,I just change some open source code and wrap them in qt,the core code is not written by me which i should say first.

Build with qt 5.0

 config:
 	u can config through the config button,otherwise it will be set to default value.At first time ,u need to draw the counting line.
 And when u set once,the setting will be stored in config/xml file.
